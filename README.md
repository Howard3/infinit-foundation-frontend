# InfinitFoundationFrontend

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to both staging and production environments on Fly.io.

### Available Commands

### First Time Setup

Before using the console commands, you need to set up SSH access to your Fly.io applications:

```bash
# Set up SSH for Fly.io applications
fly ssh issue --agent
```

This command only needs to be run once per machine. It will:
- Create an SSH key pair for Fly.io
- Register it with your Fly.io account
- Configure your local SSH client

```bash
# Deploy to staging
mix fly.staging

# Deploy to production
mix fly.production

# Deploy to staging and monitor deployment status
mix fly.staging.monitor

# Deploy to production and monitor deployment status
mix fly.production.monitor

# Connect to staging IEx console
mix fly.staging.console

# Connect to production IEx console
mix fly.production.console
```

### Configuration Files

- `fly.staging.toml` - Configuration for staging environment (staging.infinit-o.foundation)
- `fly.production.toml` - Configuration for production environment (infinit-o.foundation)

When connected to the console, you'll get an interactive IEx session where you can:
- Inspect application state
- Execute code in the running application
- Debug issues in real-time
- Run database queries

Example console usage:
```elixir
# Get application version
iex> Application.spec(:infinit_foundation_frontend, :vsn)

# Check configuration
iex> Application.get_all_env(:infinit_foundation_frontend)
```
